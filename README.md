# match-question-answers

This is a child module for the Course Conversion Tool at Brigham Young University - Idaho. Once
the course has been imported from Brightspace D2L to Canvas, the matching questions options are
inverted with the answers. This child module goes through all quizzes and inverts the matching
question options and answers to match the Brightspace D2L version.

## Pre-Import or Post-Import
This child module occurs *post-import* from Brightspace D2L to Canvas.
